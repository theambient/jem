This software package is for testing EE2.3 on harmonization between NSST and PDPC. 
The corresponding proposal found in JVETB0051.

The followings are detailed description of implementation
1) NSST index is coded/sent regardless of PDPC index
2) NSST index is signalled in CU level. NSST index is binarized with TU binarization.
3) TU level flag is coded to indicate whether the NSST index (signalled in CU level)is applied for the corresponding TU.
4) In order to speed up encoder, NSST index restriction based on PDPC index and block size is considered


The followings are macros to include the above mentioned changes based on JEM2.0

#define CU_TU_NSST                1 // NSST index is sent in CU level and TU level flag indicates if NSST is applied or not. 
#if CU_TU_NSST
#define JVET_B0059_TU_NSST_USE_HYGT                       1 // Use new secondary transform matrix and permutation in EE2.7
#define SLA_FAST                                          0 // 1: NSST idx restriction (two NSST index instead of four) based on PDPC index ==1 && block size <16
#define JVET_B0051_REMOVE_PDPC_RESTRICTION     1       // NSST is enabled regardless of the value of PDPC index 
#define JVET_B0051_NSST_UNIFIED_BINARIZATION   1   // unified binarization for NSST index and context modeling based on partition type and intra prediction mode
#if JVET_B0051_NSST_UNIFIED_BINARIZATION
#define JVET_B0051_NSST_UNIFIED_BINARIZATION2  1    // 0: NSST index range is always the same (i.e. 0~3) 1:NSST index range depends on intra prediction and partitionsize as JEM20, unified binarization for NSST index and context modeling based on partition type and intra prediction mode
