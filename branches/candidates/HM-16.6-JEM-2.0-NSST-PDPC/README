This software package is for testing EE2.3 on harmonization between NSST and PDPC. 
The corresponding proposal found in JVETB0051.

The followings are detailed description of implementation
1) NSST index is coded/sent regardless of PDPC index
2) NSST index is signalled in CU level. NSST index is binarized with TU binarization.
3) TU level flag is coded to indicate whether the NSST index (signalled in CU level)is applied for the corresponding TU.
4) In order to speed up encoder, NSST index restriction based on PDPC index and block size is considered


The followings are macros to include the above mentioned changes based on JEM2.0

#define JVET_B0051_NSST_PDPC_HARMONIZATION 1     // NSST is always allowed regardless of PDPC
#if JVET_B0051_NSST_PDPC_HARMONIZATION
#define MAX_TU_NSST 2                            // TU level flag is sent to indicate whether NSST index signalled in CU level is to be applied for a TU. 
#define JVET_B0059_TU_NSST_USE_HYGT 1            // Use new secondary transform and permutation in EE
#define SLA_FAST 1                               // NSST idx restriction (two NSST index instead of four) based on PDPC index ==1 && block size <16
